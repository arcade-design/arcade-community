## Reshaped - NextJS demo

This is an example of [Reshaped](https://reshaped.so) being used to create a social media card component.
It covers some of the layout principles Reshaped follows and provides some examples for interactive components.
It doesn't go much into stucturing of your React project so all code is written in a single file, which is totally fine for the scope of this example.

You can a video demo of this codebase being written on our [homepage](https://reshaped.so).
