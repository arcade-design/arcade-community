Reshaped Figma library and source code environment licenses are sitributed through our [website](https://reshaped.so).

It contains [examples of the project setups](./examples/) using Reshaped together with different build tools and frameworks.
We're working hard on making sure it works with the most possible amount of popular technologies while still following our principle of staying as close as possible to native browser technologies.

We build it in public as much as possible so we use this repository to [track our development and design process](https://formaat.notion.site/64cf1f5713344a7383330e0402f43949?v=b88a6dbbcb9a4faeb867d40d09ec0b12).
That should help you understand when to expect specific features to be shipped and what's already planned in the roadmap.
